# 615-final
job project
In 615 final.html, maps may not show. So I upload some html files of maps. 
As for stopwords, I upload stop_words.utf8 and set a relative path in my rmd file. 
Shiny app is in another branch. I tried to upload to bu rstudio connect but it didn't work. But in shinyapp.io, it worked. Here is the link:
